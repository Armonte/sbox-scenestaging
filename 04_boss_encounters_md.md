# Boss Encounters - Complete Design Specifications

## Primary Boss: The Reclaimer

### Boss Concept
A massive mechanical guardian with multiple phases, environmental hazards, and pressure systems. The boss represents precision engineering fused with chaotic energy, requiring both mechanical execution and adaptive coordination.

### Arena Design
**Layout**: Circular arena, 40-meter diameter
**Zones**:
- **Central boss area** (12m radius) - Boss positioning and melee range
- **Movement ring** (12-18m radius) - Primary player positioning zone
- **Outer ring** (18-20m radius) - Orb disposal zones and mote spawn points

**Environmental Elements**:
- 4 disposal zones at cardinal directions for Volatile Charges
- 8 mote spawn points around perimeter
- Elevated walkways for traversal breaks between phases
- Hazard placement zones for dynamic environmental threats

## Core Encounter Mechanics

### 1. Volatile Charges (Tank-Focused Mechanic)
**Concept**: Timed explosive orbs requiring coordinated handling and disposal

#### Spawn Behavior
- **Phase 1**: 3 orbs spawn at predetermined positions around arena perimeter
- **Phase 2**: 3 orbs spawn with 10-second timers (increased pressure)
- **Intermission**: 6 orbs spawn simultaneously (chaos test)
- **Spawn Timer**: 12-15 seconds from spawn to explosion

#### Player Interaction
- **Pickup**: Press E to collect orb, applies movement penalty and debuff
- **Movement Penalty**: 25% speed reduction (tanks exempt via Orb Mastery)
- **Debuff System**: "Volatile Exposure" - 50% increased damage per stack, 30s duration
- **Disposal**: Must be carried to disposal zones (glowing safe areas)

#### Failure States
- **Timer Expiration**: Instant group wipe, no recovery possible
- **Carrier Death**: Orb explodes after 3-second delay, likely group wipe

#### Tank Specialization
- **No movement penalty** when carrying orbs (Orb Mastery passive)
- **Reduced debuff intensity** (25% vs 50% damage increase)
- **Emergency Pull ability** for crisis management
- **Natural coordinator** and primary carrier role

#### Team Coordination Requirements
- Tank calls orb assignments and timing
- DPS provides escort and mote clearing during carries
- Healer manages debuff stacks with Cleanse ability
- Communication essential for 6-orb intermission phase

### 2. Ephemeral Motes (DPS-Focused Mechanic)
**Concept**: Add waves that must be intercepted before reaching the boss

#### Spawn Pattern
- **Phase 1**: Every 20 seconds, 2-3 motes per wave
- **Phase 2**: Every 15 seconds, 3-4 motes with shields
- **Phase 3**: Every 8-5 seconds, 4-6 motes with acceleration

#### Mote Behavior
- **Health**: 100 HP base (1-2 shots for DPS to kill)
- **Movement**: Slow, predictable pathing toward boss center
- **Boss Buff**: Each mote that reaches boss grants 10% damage increase (stacking)
- **Shield Mechanic**: Phase 2+ motes spawn with energy shields

#### Shield System
- **Immunity**: Shielded motes immune to all damage
- **Removal**: Only DPS Purification Beam can remove shields
- **Vulnerability Window**: Shield removal makes mote vulnerable for 5 seconds
- **Coordination**: Requires DPS timing for shield removal and elimination

#### DPS Specialization
- **Exclusive Shield Removal**: Only DPS role can use Purification Beam
- **Enhanced Mobility**: Increased movement speed for optimal interception
- **Damage Scaling**: Motes die faster to DPS attacks
- **Evasion Abilities**: Allow risky positioning for intercepts

#### Team Coordination Requirements
- Tank positions boss for predictable mote pathing
- DPS calls priority targets and shield removal timing
- Healer maintains DPS health during aggressive intercepts
- Late phases require multiple DPS or perfect coordination

### 3. Planetcracker Beams (Team Movement Mechanic)
**Concept**: Rotating laser walls forcing coordinated positioning and movement

#### Phase Variations

**Phase 1**:
- **Pattern**: 2 rotating beams with 90° safe gaps
- **Rotation Speed**: 45° per second
- **Damage**: 300 damage per second contact
- **Purpose**: Learning phase for basic movement patterns

**Phase 2**:
- **Pattern**: 3 rotating beams with 60° safe gaps
- **Rotation Speed**: 60° per second
- **Damage**: 400 damage per second contact
- **Challenge**: Requires more precise positioning and timing

**Phase 3**:
- **Pattern**: 4 rotating beams with no safe gaps
- **Rotation Speed**: 75° per second
- **Damage**: 500 damage per second contact
- **Requirement**: Team must rotate around boss in perfect synchronization

#### Visual Design
- **Appearance**: Bright energy beams with particle effects
- **Telegraphs**: Ground projections show beam paths 2 seconds before activation
- **Audio**: Distinct sound cues with building intensity for each phase

#### Team Coordination Requirements
- **Callouts**: Movement coordination and synchronization
- **DPS Adaptation**: Evasion ability for risky positioning
- **Tank Mitigation**: Can briefly "tank" beam damage with cooldowns
- **Healer Support**: Emergency healing for positioning mistakes

### 4. Reclaim Shield Phases (Healer-Focused Mechanic)
**Concept**: Boss becomes immune and pulls team together for coordinated DPS burn

#### Trigger Conditions
- **Phase 1**: 75% boss health threshold
- **Phase 2**: 45% boss health threshold

#### Mechanics Sequence
1. **Immunity**: Boss becomes immune to all damage
2. **Shield Generation**: Creates large absorption shield (scaled to player count)
3. **Team Pull**: Pulls all players toward center over 3 seconds
4. **Timer**: 30-second limit to break shield or face "Reclaim Blast"

#### Shield Health Scaling
- **Base Formula**: 3000 HP + 500 per player
- **3 Players**: 4500 HP shield
- **6 Players**: 6000 HP shield

#### Failure Condition
- **Reclaim Blast**: Timer expiration triggers massive AoE likely to wipe group
- **Success Requirement**: Coordinated DPS focus and healing support

#### Healer Specialization
- **Group Sustain**: Healing during boss pull and incoming damage
- **Resource Management**: Ensure team has abilities ready
- **Emergency Saves**: Divine Shield for critical save moments
- **Coordination**: Team positioning and ability usage timing

### 5. Shatter (Disruption Mechanic)
**Concept**: Periodic knockback attack that disrupts positioning and orb carrying

#### Timing and Effects
- **Frequency**: Every 25 seconds (Phase 1), every 20 seconds (Phase 2+)
- **Area**: 8-meter radius AoE around boss
- **Damage**: 500 damage + significant knockback force
- **Telegraph**: 1.5-second warning with ground effects and audio

#### Strategic Impact
- **Orb Disruption**: Can cause carriers to drop orbs or miss disposal zones
- **Positioning**: Can push players into Planetcracker Beams
- **Decision Making**: Forces positioning choices around boss proximity
- **Tank Advantage**: +50% knockback resistance as passive benefit

### 6. Eternity Overdrive (Soft Enrage - Phase 3)
**Concept**: Escalating pressure system creating final burn phase urgency

#### Activation
- **Trigger**: Beginning of Phase 3 (45% boss health)
- **Purpose**: Creates natural time limit without hard enrage cutoff

#### Escalation Mechanics
- **Base Damage**: 50 DPS to all players, increases by 10 every 10 seconds
- **Mote Acceleration**: Spawn rate increases from 8s to 5s over time
- **Mote Absorption**: Every 10 seconds, boss instantly pulls all active motes
- **Mechanic Removal**: No more Volatile Charges (focus on execution)

#### Strategic Pressure
- **Healing Challenge**: Becomes increasingly difficult as damage ramps
- **Mote Control**: Critical as spawn rate accelerates
- **Balance Required**: Team must balance boss damage with mote management
- **Natural Timer**: Creates urgency without arbitrary failure
