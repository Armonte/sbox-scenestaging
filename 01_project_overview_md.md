- **Phase 2**: Complexity (75% ‚Üí 45% HP) 
- **Traversal Break 2**: 6-orb chaos test
- **Phase 3**: Burn phase (45% ‚Üí 0% HP)

### Orc Chieftain (Secondary Boss)
**Dimensional shift mechanics with shadow realm phases:**
- **Club slam attacks** with ground telegraphs

## Progression Systems

### Trunk Progression (12 Levels)
**Levels 1-4**: Basic utility (Grab, Slam, Shield)

**Levels 9-11**: Reality manipulation (Champion Reach, Royal Command, Cosmic Power)
**Level 12**: Transcendent Supremacy (encounter-ending abilities)

### Proc System (Brobaon's Design)
- **Coordination bonuses** for team synergy
- **Bad luck protection** preventing failure streaks
- **Skill expression** through probability manipulation
- **RuneScape-inspired** mechanics and psychology

## Monetization Strategy

### Essential Purchases
- **Lactaid Pills** ($2.99) - Removes Leo's lactose intolerance
- **Trunk Enhancement Serum** ($4.99) - Temporary trunk level boost

- **Built-in networking** with hot-reloading support
- **Scene/GameObject/Component** system

### Target Performance
- **60+ FPS** stable with 6 players
- **<100ms** ability response latency
- **<2GB** total memory usage
- **Network stability** under full load

## Development Timeline
**21-day sprint** to working prototype:
- **Week 1**: Foundation and basic trinity
- **Week 2**: Encounter mechanics and integration
- **Week 3**: Polish, scaling, and monetization

## Team Structure
- **monte (10%)**: S&Box integration, performance optimization
- **Claude (90%)**: Primary implementation and systems programming
- **Radakai**: Combat feel and skill expression validation
- **ComfortingSmile**: MMO authenticity and UI/UX design
- **Brobaon (MR. FOSTER)**: Proc systems and probability design
- **CatSugoKyam**: Creative design and visual concepts
