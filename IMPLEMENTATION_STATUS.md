## üîß HOW TO SETUP IN S&BOX EDITOR

### 1. Scene Setup
1. Open `Assets/Scenes/Tests/Reclaimer/reclaimer_boss_encounter.scene`
2. Create a GameObject called "NetworkManager"
3. Attach `TrinitySpawnManager` component
4. Configure the prefab references:
   - **TankPrefab**: Create prefab with LeoTank component
   - **HealerPrefab**: Create prefab with AbbyHealer component  
   - **DPSPrefab**: Create prefab with TrunkWarrior component
   - **DefaultPlayerPrefab**: Basic player for temp spawning

### 2. Player Prefab Setup
Each trinity class prefab needs:
- `CharacterController` component
- `CitizenAnimationHelper` component
- `SkinnedModelRenderer` with citizen model
- `NameTagPanel` component (optional)
- Body and Eye GameObject references configured

### 3. Testing Enemies
- Create GameObjects with `BasicEnemy` component for testing
- Place around the scene for ability testing

### 4. Spawn Points (Optional)
- Create empty GameObjects as spawn points
- Add to SpawnPoints list in TrinitySpawnManager

## üéÆ TESTING THE SYSTEM

### Basic Tests
1. **Connection Test**: Multiple players should be able to connect
2. **Class Selection**: Players should see class selection UI
3. **Role Limits**: Tank limited to 1, others to 2
4. **Movement**: Basic WASD movement should work
5. **Camera**: Third-person camera should follow player

### Ability Tests
- **Leo (Tank)**: Try ability1 for shell parry, ability2 for Lil Frank
- **Abby (Healer)**: Cork gun enemies, then milk gun allies  
- **Trunk (DPS)**: Grab enemies with ability1, slam with ability1 again

### Network Tests
- **[Sync] Properties**: Health/mana should sync across clients
- **RPCs**: Abilities should be visible to all players
- **Server Authority**: Only host should run enemy AI

## üêõ KNOWN LIMITATIONS

- No visual effects or particles yet
- Basic placeholder models
- Simplified combat system  
- No boss encounter mechanics yet
- No proc system implementation
- No cash shop integration

## üìã NEXT STEPS

1. **Test in Editor**: Verify trinity classes spawn and work
2. **Basic Combat**: Ensure damage/healing works between players/enemies
3. **Boss Mechanics**: Implement VolatileCharge, Motes, Beams
4. **Visual Polish**: Add effects, animations, UI improvements
5. **Proc System**: Implement RuneScape-inspired RNG mechanics

The foundation is solid and ready for editor testing!
