# Quick Fix - Cork Revolver Setup

## The Two Issues from Your Log:

### Issue 1: "CorkProjectilePrefab not assigned in inspector!"
**Fix**: You need to assign the prefab in the CorkRevolver component

### Issue 2: "CorkRevolver must be attached to AbbyHealer!" 
**Fix**: The code now handles this better with fallback logic

## Step-by-Step Fix:

### 1. Create Cork Projectile Prefab (If you haven't)
1. **Create GameObject**: "CorkProjectile" 
2. **Add Components**:
   - **Rigidbody**
   - **SelfDestructComponent** (set Seconds = 5)
   - **CorkProjectile**
3. **Add Child**: "CorkVisual"
   - **ModelRenderer** (cube model)
   - **BoxCollider** 
   - **Scale to 0.1, 0.1, 0.1**
4. **Save as Prefab**: Drag to Assets folder

### 2. Assign the Prefab
1. **Select your CorkRevolverGun** object in the scene
2. **Find CorkRevolver component** in inspector  
3. **Drag CorkProjectile.prefab** to the **CorkProjectilePrefab** slot

### 3. Test Again
- The code now uses the same pattern as the working Gun.cs
- Better fallback for finding AbbyHealer
- Should spawn corks properly now

## What I Changed in the Code:

1. **Simplified cloning** to match Gun.cs exactly:
   ```csharp
   var cork = CorkProjectilePrefab.Clone(pos);
   cork.Enabled = true;
   rigidbody.Velocity = fireDirection * ProjectileSpeed;
   cork.NetworkSpawn();
   ```

2. **Better AbbyHealer finding**:
   - First tries ancestor hierarchy
   - If that fails, searches entire scene
   - More robust than before

3. **Removed complex validation** that might have been causing issues

## Expected Result:
- âœ… "Cork Revolver initialized for [PlayerName] with prefab: CorkProjectile"
- âœ… Cork cubes should spawn and fly forward
- âœ… No more "invalid GameObject" errors
- âœ… Active reload still works after 6 shots

The key was following the **exact same pattern** as the working Gun.cs from the S&Box testbed! ðŸš€
