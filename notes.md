cash shop mechanic: theres a cash shop in game where you have to buy items because the game is pay to win.

It has to do damage to build up the milk reserve and can use its milk to heal people. But you can't just sit on your milk because it will spoil. Abby has an aoe heal ultimate ability where she falls over and spills her milk and cries and its an aoe heal and shes rooted for a couple seconds and everyone in the aoe is invincible for a short period, but afterwords the puddle stays for a bit and you can still heal some. abby can sing and its an aoe radius around her that stuns enemies, milksong. this ability is labelled cumming soon and when casted is a random proc 1/100 chance for her to actually sing. it doesnt go on cooldown until it actually triggers. then it's on a 10 second cooldown. when it finally procs it plays a specific sfx im coming. can set milk puddle portals and allies can teleport between them.)

tank (a turtle, Leo, the Phranklyn class. they have two-handed sword. they have a parry mechanic. to parry you have to enter your shell which means you have to drop your sword. this is a timed parry, and if you fail you get knocked back, and walk and pick up your sword. if your parry is successful you exit your shell and autopick your sword and get a movespeed buff. The turtle can turn its head 180 degrees, when its head is facing the same direction as its shell it's the battle stance and you do 10% reduced damage but you take less damage. when its facing the other way, the normal way, defensive stance, you do 10% more damage and take 10% more damage. he has an aoe attack he can do where he goes into his shell and on the floor and spins his sword around as he spins. Leo is lactose intolerant, so by default takes reduced 50% healing from our healing class holy milker, but you can remedy this by buying lactaid in the cash shop. has an ability where he can summon his child with abby, lil frank a milk jug with a turtle shell and lil frank comes in spinning and does a 2-3 hit beatup attack on the target.  )



dps (mighty trunk class, says a lot of trunk puns and over does it. replaces fuck with trunk whenever they can. trunk grab, long ranged cone attack that pulls enemies in and sets up for a combo after theyre pulled in where you use a short ranged aoe trunk slam that has knock up which knocks the enemies up into the air and interrupts their casts. also has trunk whirl where you spin around and can move your character around while you spin and hit things with your trunk. has extendo-trunk esque ability where it acts as a reverse hook, you cast this to a location and your trunk is extended and you reel in and your trunk shortens and at the end of the animation when youre fully reeled in you get a damage bonus and do a small aoe where nearby teammates and you get a slight movement speed buff. )




orc chieftan that slams club down at intervals, aoe attack, shadow appears on ground before 

can call reinforcement goblins and slam down club, some have short sword and will wind up and charge in a line while swinging their sword, and there are archers that shoot aoe rain of arrows in arc. if you get hit by the rain of arrows you get rooted for 10 seconds 


big mechanic: dimensional shift, happens every 25% of his hp is lost:

raises club up really high getting ready to super slam and portal opens up at his feet and everyone has to run into the portal and you port into the same arena just a different dimension, and theres a shadow version of the orc chieftan and you have to kill the evil shadow within the orc dimension and once you kill that a portal opens up in the shadow and you can re-enter the original dimension, but if you dont kill the shadow orc in time, the shadow dimension explodes and kills everyone, its a dps check to come back out. when you complete this, you get a damage amp and can wail on the boss for a moment, he falls to his knees and then gets back up after a second
